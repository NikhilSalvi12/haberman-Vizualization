# Haberman-Vizualization
Visualize and draw conclusion on the data based on observation

# Overview
Given the Haberman dataset, Visuvalize and draw conclusion based on observation.

# Objective
* Cleasning of data.
* Vizualizing using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
* Do multivariate, bivariate and univariate analysis.
* Draw conclusion based on the observation.

# Inference drawn
There is a shortage of data but we can conclude some rough conclusions.
* As the No. of positive lymph nodes increases the survival chances decreases.
* Also, we can see that the No. of lymph nodes is lower than 5 and more concentrated.
* Hence, the non-survival cases are more of the outliers from lymph nodes(only 50% survival rate).
* The year of treatment doesn't seem to have effect on Survival rate.
